Each round is as follows:

- The player chooses bet
- The dealer draws two cards from a shuffled deck
- The dealer's first card is a mystery, but the second one is shown
- The player draws two cards
- Both cards are shown to player
- The player is repeatedly given the option to hit or stand
- The player eventually either busts or stands
- The dealer hits until >= 17 hand value
- The player is paid accordingly and their balance is stored in info.csv
- The round increments and is also stored in info.csv
